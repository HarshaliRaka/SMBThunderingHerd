Description:
The idea here is to assist small firms in helping their employees save taxes. It is a personal dashboard for the employers which helps them keep track of their hiring and at the same time has certain personalized features detailed below.

The employer lands on the first page of the web app. This will give him options to view the top 10 most widely sold items online, to add an employee to his small firm and to view all his employees. Side by side there is a scheduler running that will send personalized mails to the employee which will assist him in saving taxes. The algorithm is based on calculating the net total income of an employee, the tax that he pays and the minimum tax that he could have paid. We provide him all the options that he could invest in considering the amount of funds he has which will help him save up his taxes. The scheduler also runs a logic to send the employee his pay slip and salary slip per month. The purpose of showing the top 10 most bought items online (in this case we have used eBay API’s to extract these items) is to encourage him to populate his inventory with these items to increase his sales. These items can be generated by category and therefore can help the merchant further in knowing what the trending items are for his specific category of merchandizing.

Overall, the app helps a great deal in helping a merchant know what’s good for his sales and also keeping track record of his employees. It cares about the employees too. It’s a win-win situation for everyone in this case.

The app is built on Ruby on Rails platform and padrino for mailer.
